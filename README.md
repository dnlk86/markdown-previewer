# Markdow previewer

This was the second project of the Front End Development Libraries section of the FreeCodeCamp curriculum.
[Build a Markdown Previewer](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-development-libraries/front-end-development-libraries-projects/build-a-markdown-previewer)

## Technologies

In order fulfill the project's requirements I decided to use the following technologies:

-   create react app using the template react-redux
-   markedjs for parsing the input passed in the editor
-   a mix of html css and vanilla js for styling and functionality such as the split view
-   github pages for deployment
